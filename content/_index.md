**LR Mesh** is a community of individuals working to build a network of Meshtastic radios in the Central Arkansas area. This network acts like a area-wide text messaging system, allowing people to communicate publicly or privately with anyone on the network. The mesh network can also be used to transmit a GPS locations or read weather and other telemetry. All of this happens without any external infrastructure – no cell phone towers, no internet.  We are growing every day.  

Please join us and feel free to ask questions in the **US Arkansas** channel on the [**Discord Server**](https://discord.gg/meshtastic-867578229534359593).


### What is Meshtastic
This project is 100% community driven and open source!

Meshtastic is an open-source, decentralized, off-grid mesh network. It’s made up of small communicators that can form a mesh network. These devices can be linked to a phone via bluetooth or WiFi. Meshtastic uses inexpensive LoRa radios as a long-range communications platform.

### How Does It Work
Meshtastic utilizes LoRa, a long-range radio protocol, which is widely accessible in most regions without the need for additional licenses or certifications, unlike HAM radio operations.

These radios are designed to rebroadcast messages they receive, forming a mesh network. This setup ensures that every group member, including those at the furthest distance, can receive messages. Depending on the settings employed, the Meshtastic mesh network can support up to 100 devices concurrently.

Additionally, Meshtastic radios can be paired with a single phone, allowing friends and family to send messages directly to your specific radio. It’s important to note that each device is capable of supporting a connection from only one user at a time.
