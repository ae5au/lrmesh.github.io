### Recommended Configuration

This section will address a few mistakes new mesh users might make.

* Please do not enable MQTT Downlink on the default LongFast Channel this will flood our local mesh with hundreds of nodes in different countries.

* Please do not set your message hop limit more than 4 hops.

* Please keep communications on the default channel clean as many schools are also experimenting with Meshtastic.

* Please enable a fixed GPS location if you are not dynamically updating. We encourage not setting the location to your house or office just somewhere close so other users can see signal propagation.

* If you plan on setting up a Router node please contact us. This will allow coordination between router owners and make for a more reliable network.
